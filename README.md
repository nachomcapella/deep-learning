This repository contains two examples of neural networks applied to classification problems.

**1.  Housing prices** :house_with_garden:: Uses a feedforward neural network to classify houses according to their location using the California Housing Prices dataset.

**2. Traffic signs** :car:: Uses both feedforward and convolutional neural networks to work with the [German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=dataset) and the [CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). Concerning the German signs dataset, apart from classifying the road signs, they are also identified within a larger picture.
