### Detect the ten lessons from Celeste (just list them and add your own interpretation)
#### Miguel P√©rez
Hone interpertional communications (we barely maintain conversations)
How to interview:
1.  **Don‚Äôt multitask** (don‚Äôt think about the next thing).
   - I think it is important, since we tend to put some conversations in the background and not 	really paying attention to the talker

2.  **Don‚Äôt pontifcate** (don‚Äôt be dogmatic or pompous).
   - Some times we try to convert our speech in the absolute truth of the universe, so we need
	to correctly address our audience
3.  **Use open ended questions**. Don‚Äôt ask questions for a simple response.
   - Open questions are always more rich, personal and interactive. Computers can provide brief 	analytical responses, but just humans are able to develop really unique descriptions and tell 	personal stories
4.  **Go with the flow**. Ask that it comes to your mind in the logic of the conversations.
   - I don‚Äôt pretty much agree with this one, some things are worth it to be retained and 	addressed, even if they are sometimes out of place
5.  **If you don‚Äôt know, say that you don‚Äôt know**.
   - True, we live in the expert society, and we sometimes believe we are the voice of the truth.
	We need to know our place and give the voice to the true experts to fight fake news and 	misinformation
6.  **Don‚Äôt compare experiences**. Any experience is comparable, and don‚Äôt try to be the protagonist.
   - Yes, we need to have an ego, but not to eclipse other people. Otherwise they will feel 	invaded and attacked, so they will avoid us in the future and discard us as a valid 	listener/speaker
7.  **Do not repeat yourself**, it is boring and not usable.
   - Yes, this is important, and I think that even saying things in different ways is sometimes a 	useful tool to keep the audience entertained
8.  **Stay out of the weeds**, do not lose in fine details.
   - I agree in this general statements but some details make the story more interesting. For me 	the important thing is to know which details are key to mention
9.  **Listen**.
   - I like the thing she quoted: we listen only to reply. I think we do not consider reading in the 	same way, and this is because sometimes we take listening as a bidirectional act when 	sometimes it is not.
10. **Be brief!**
  - Super important, in my opinion the most one. In this youtube format society, you need to 	keep to the listener‚Äôs curve of attention, which commonly is not longer than 10-12 mins. A 	brief talk that awakes curiosity and inspires is more impactful than 45 mins of full core 	technical content, which can bore and even provoke reactive feelings to that matter.

#### Daniel Saiz
1. **Do not multitask**. That means, be compromised with the conversation, be part of it or leave it.

2.    **Do not pontificate**. Do not state your opinion if you do not want to defend it or receive any kind of feedback.
3.	**Use open-ended questions**. Do not use yes-no questions because that would cause short questions. Open-ended questions will make the answer be deeper and more personal.
4.	**Go with the flow**. Express your thoughts just when they come up to your mind otherwise, it may seem like you question could interrupt the conversation.
5.  **If you don't know, say that you don't know**. Don‚Äôt talk about topics that you don‚Äôt know. It is better to say that you don‚Äôt know and let the experts speak. You will not seem an ignorant, but a curious and humble person.
6.	**Don't equate your experience with theirs**. If someone is telling a personal experience, don‚Äôt interrupt or tell a similar experience. You may seem to be bringing him or her down. Don‚Äôt compare with the rest.
7.	**Try not to repeat yourself**. It might make the conversation boring if you repeat yourself a lot. Keep the chat fresh by adding new things, topics and experiences.
8.	**Stay out of the weeds**. People may not be interested in the details of your experience. Making a summary avoiding useless details for what you really want to express is recommended.
9.	**Listen**. This is the most important rule to follow when a conversation. Not paying attention to what is being told doesn‚Äôt make the conversation flow and may be seen as disrespectful. But listening can be improved by making questions to the person who has just talked so he/she will feel that you were listening.
10.	**Be brief**. Don‚Äôt grab your turn to speak and be concise.


#### Ignacio Mart√≠nez
1. **Do not multitask**: Be present, be in the moment. You are in a conversation, not in other situation. So do not let your mind wander to other things while the conversation is right in front of you, taking place now and not later.

2. **Do not pontificate**: Do not state yoor opinion expecting no critic. You do not have the absolute truth and you can always learn something new with each conversation. Most of the times people will debate with you and you will improve and enrich your views on the subject.
3. **Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you do not**: Every person is different, with different interests and knowledge. Every person you meet can teach you something.
4. **Use open ending questions**: Use simple questions to get complicated answers, so that people give more elaborated and interesting responses. Try to ask about how people feel or about what they think. Avoid questions that can be answered with a yes or a no.
5. **Go with the flow**: Follow your spontaneous ideas and let the echange of information be natural. If you want to say something but the opportunity has passed, let it go and continue listening.
6. **If you do not know, say that you do not know**: There is no problem in admitting you do not know about a topic. It is better to do that than to pretend you do and make a fool of yourself.
7. **Do not equate your experience with theirs**: Everybody feels things differently. What was easy or not important for you may have been a hard and importad situation for another person. You do not need to be the centre of attention, so do not speak about yourself but rather try to understand the other.
8. **Try not to repeat yourself**: People are not stupid. If you have made your point they have listened to it. There is no need to repeat it.
9. **Stay out of the weeds**: People do not need all the details of a story. They care about you and what you felt. The specifics are not important.
10. **Listen**: We may prefer to be the one talking and we often get distracted. However, if you are in a conversation you may as well pay attention to what the other people are saying.

###  In groups of three: negotiate and select the three that are more relevant for you and argue why
1. **Be brief** ‚è≥: If you have something important to say, let it stand out by not burying under a lot of less relevant information. People's attention span is limited and time is valuable, so be concise and concentrate on your main idea.

2. **Listen** üëÇ: Conversations are not monologues. You may have your opinion, but so do others. Try to understand their point of view, so you can learn more about them and also reevaluate your own opinions. People will appreciate it and you will learn something.

3. **Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you do not**: Every person is different, with different interests and knowledge. Every person you meet can teach you something.
